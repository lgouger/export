== Additional Parameters

With the new formatter closure you can combine multiple attributes:

[source, groovy]
----
	// Formatter closure
          def title = { domain, value ->
		return domain?.author + ": " + domain?.title
	}
----

[WARNING]
====
Version 0.7 changes formatter closures. To upgrade from a previous release you need to add the domain argument to your closures as shown in the code sample above.
